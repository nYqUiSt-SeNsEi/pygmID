# pygmID
Python Version of [Prof. Boris Murmann](https://murmann-group.stanford.edu/mediawiki/index.php/Boris_Murmann)'s [gm/ID starter kit](https://web.stanford.edu/~murmann/gmid).

There is already a Python version of this kit written by [Ashwith](https://github.com/ashwith/pyMOSChar). 
This one works really great.
